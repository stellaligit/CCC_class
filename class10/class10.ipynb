He decides to perform the following trick to persuade you: Given a list of N shuffled cards, where each card has a unique number from {1,2,…,N} written on it, he'll guess the numbers on the cards. Knowing that this is highly improbable, you call his bluff. He then continues to tell you that he still needs one more piece of information for this trick to work. For every card in the deck, he needs to know how many cards after of this card has a bigger number written on it. Being a Computer Science student, you claim that you can write a program to do this simple trick as well.\n",

The following line will contain N numbers, separated by a space. Where each number represents the count of cards in the deck, with a larger value than the card in the position of that number. e.g. a list that starts with \"1 3 2 …\" says that there is 1 card greater than the first in the deck, 3 cards greater than the second card in the deck, etc.\n",
