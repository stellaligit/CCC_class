    "## The Luhn Algorithm\n",
    "In the 1950's, Hans Peter Luhn invented a method for checking the validity of ID numbers. This method (known as the Luhn Algorithm or the Luhn Formula) is still used today for a number of different purposes, including all major credit card numbers and Social Insurance Numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the Luhn Algorithm works when checking for a valid ID number:\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the right, double every second digit, add up the digits of the result, and total up all the resulting numbers.\n",
    "Add to this total the sum of all the remaining digits.\n",
    "If the result is divisible by 10, the id number is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Validate 42395\n",
    "#### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "9 × 2 = 18 → 1 + 8 = 9\n",
    "\n",
    "2 × 2 = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "4 + 9 = 13\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "13 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "25 is not divisible by 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Validate 35436\n",
    "#### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "3 × 2 = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "5 × 2 = 10 → 1 + 0 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1 + 6 = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "7 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "20 is divisible by 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "The last digit of every number is the \"check digit\" and the rest of it is the base number. So in the first example above, 4239 is the base number and 5 is the check digit. When generating card numbers or other ID numbers, you first generate the base number without the final digit, then you figure out what the check digit has to be to make the whole ID number valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specification\n",
    "The input will contain 5 test cases. Each test case consists of a batch of 5 base numbers (1 to 100 digits each) on one line, each separated by a single space character. Your job is to compute the check digit for each base number in the batch and then output the result as a single 5-digit number.\n",
