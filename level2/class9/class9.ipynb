    "## The Luhn Algorithm\n",
    "In the 1950's, Hans Peter Luhn invented a method for checking the validity of ID numbers. This method (known as the Luhn Algorithm or the Luhn Formula) is still used today for a number of different purposes, including all major credit card numbers and Social Insurance Numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the Luhn Algorithm works when checking for a valid ID number:\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the right, double every second digit, add up the digits of the result, and total up all the resulting numbers.\n",
    "Add to this total the sum of all the remaining digits.\n",
    "If the result is divisible by 10, the id number is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Validate 42395\n",
    "#### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "9 × 2 = 18 → 1 + 8 = 9\n",
    "\n",
    "2 × 2 = 4\n",
    "\n",
    "4 + 9 = 13\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "13 + 4 + 3 + 5 = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "25 is not divisible by 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2: Validate 35436\n",
    "#### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "3 × 2 = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "5 × 2 = 10 → 1 + 0 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1 + 6 = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "7 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 20\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "20 is divisible by 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "The last digit of every number is the \"check digit\" and the rest of it is the base number. So in the first example above, 4239 is the base number and 5 is the check digit. When generating card numbers or other ID numbers, you first generate the base number without the final digit, then you figure out what the check digit has to be to make the whole ID number valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specification\n",
    "The input will contain 5 test cases. Each test case consists of a batch of 5 base numbers (1 to 100 digits each) on one line, each separated by a single space character. Your job is to compute the check digit for each base number in the batch and then output the result as a single 5-digit number.\n",

    "You've been snowed in at your summer residence. And without the Internet! Unfortunately, this means you're going to have rely on using the phone to get what you need to survive: pizza, pop, and the latest video games.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, companies replace the digits in their phone numbers with characters to make their phone numbers more memorable. Because apparently, it's easier to remember 416-BUY-MORE than it is to remember 416-289-6673. Some companies even add extra digits or characters (like 604-PIZZABOX) but any digits after the 10th are irrelevant.\n",

    "Since it's getting tedious to do the conversion by hand, write a program to help change all the phone numbers in your phone book to the form xxx-xxx-xxxx, using the below image to assist you.\n",
