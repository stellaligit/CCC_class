    "## Nasty Numbers\n",
    "We will call a positive integer nasty if it has at least two pairs of positive integer factors such that the difference of one pair equals the sum of the other pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, 6 is nasty since 6×1=6,2×3=6,6−1=2+3; and 24 is also nasty since 12−2=6+4.\n",

    "Given an array of N integers, the task is to count all the triplets such that sum of two elements equal the third element. When counting triplets, only count the unique ones. A unique triplet is when all three numbers of the triplet put in increasing order are unique, for example, the triples 1 2 3 and 3 2 1 are not unique, but the triplets 8 5 3 and 8 4 4 are unique. The triplets themselves do not necessarily have to be unique, this means that 8 4 4 can be possible, as long as the 2 4s do not have the same index.\n",
