There are N students numbered from 1 to N initially huddled up in a circle, with student i−1 to the left of student i for all 2≤i≤N, and student N to the left of student 1. They've decided to play a game of the classic tug of war, and it is known that student i has a strength of si. To make teams, they will follow the following procedure:\n",

    "The fairness of the match is measured by the absolute difference between the sum of strengths of the students in team A and team B, with the fairest game occurring when the difference is minimum.
