    "Pero has negotiated a Very Good data plan with his internet provider. The provider will let Pero use up X megabytes to surf the internet per month. Each megabyte that he doesn't spend in that month gets transferred to the next month and can still be spent. Of course, Pero can only spend the megabytes he actually has.\n",

In the third month, out of 20 (10+10) total megabytes, Pero has spent 2 and transferred 18. In the fourth month, he had a total of 28 megabytes to spend.\n",
