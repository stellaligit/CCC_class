    "## Distance\n",
    "Eric wants to visit all N of his friends. Each friend lives at house i, labelled from 1 to N. Each house is separated by a single kilometre, meaning that the distance between house i and house j would be |i−j|. He decides to be a \"cool kid\", and not travel a certain distance more than once.\n",

    "As a 30 WPM typer, you are sitting in a computer lab playing a modified version of TypeRacer in hopes of increasing your typing speed. In this game, your goal is to transform a given string of lowercase characters S into a new string of lowercase characters T. S is the string you start with on your screen. In one keystroke, you can delete a character from the back of the current string on your screen, or you can add a new lowercase character to the back of the current string. Since you strive to be as fast as possible, please compute the minimum number of keystrokes needed to transform S into T.\n",
