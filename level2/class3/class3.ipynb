    "\n",
    "There are N fence posts (3≤N≤100) at distinct points (X1,Y1)…(XN,YN) on the 2D map of his farm. He can choose three of them to form the vertices of the triangular pasture as long as one of the sides of the triangle is parallel to the x-axis and another side is parallel to the y-axis.\n",

    "A little known fact about cows is that they have their own version of the alphabet, the \"cowphabet\". It consists of the 26 letters a through z, but when a cow speaks the cowphabet, she lists these letters in a specific ordering that might be different from the order abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz we are used to hearing. To pass the time, Bessie the cow has been humming the cowphabet over and over again, and Farmer John is curious how many times she's hummed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a lowercase string of letters that Farmer John has heard Bessie say, compute the minimum number of times Bessie must have hummed the entire cowphabet in order for Farmer John to have heard the given string. Farmer John isn't always paying attention to what Bessie hums, and so he might have missed some of the letters that Bessie has hummed. The string you are told consists of just the letters that he remembers hearing.\n",
