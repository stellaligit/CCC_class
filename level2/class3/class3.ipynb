    "A little known fact about cows is that they have their own version of the alphabet, the \"cowphabet\". It consists of the 26 letters a through z, but when a cow speaks the cowphabet, she lists these letters in a specific ordering that might be different from the order abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz we are used to hearing. To pass the time, Bessie the cow has been humming the cowphabet over and over again, and Farmer John is curious how many times she's hummed it.\n",
