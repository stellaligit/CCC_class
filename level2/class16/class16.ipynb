    "Given a sequence of digits generated by the machine, please determine how many of the coins are counterfeit $2 coins. As there are no $5 coins in circulation, you can assume that if you see 25 in the sequence, it represents a non-counterfeit $25 coin. Otherwise, if you see a 2 in the sequence that is not followed by a 5, you can assume that it is a counterfeit coin.\n",
