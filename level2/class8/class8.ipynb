    "## Dan's Power Attack\n",
    "Dan is fighting with N monsters, numbered from 1 to N. The i-th monster has a health point of hi. If a monster's health point becomes 0 or below, the monster is dead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dan has two types of attacks as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular attack: Dan will choose a monster and decrease the monster's health point by D.\n",
    "Powerful attack: Dan will choose a monster and decrease the monster's health point to 0 (i.e. directly kill the monster).\n",
    "But Dan can only use the powerful attack for at most K times. Can you help Dan to figure out the minimum number of regular attacks Dan needs so that he can kill all monsters?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Specification\n",
    "The first line of input contains three integers N, D, and K (1≤N≤2×105, 1≤D≤109, and 0≤K≤2×105), indicating the number of monsters, the damage for each regular attack, and the limit for the powerful attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line of input contains N integers, hi (1≤hi≤109), the health point of the i-th monster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Specification\n",
    "Output one integer, the minimum number of regular attacks Dan needs so that he can kill all monsters.\n",
    "\n",

    "3 | 60 | No additional constraints.\n",
