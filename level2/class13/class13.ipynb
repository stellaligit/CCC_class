    "## Terrific Triangles\n",
    "Plasmatic is having a test on the different types of triangles! However, he is unable to answer any questions because he was playing videogames in online classes. He vaguely remembers that the teacher taught 3 types of triangles -- acute, right and obtuse, but he doesn't remember how to identify any of them. He doesn't want to fail the test, so he needs your help to write a program to solve his problems.\n",

    "### Input Specification\n",
    "The first line contains T (1≤T≤105), the number of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the following T lines contains l1,l2,l3 (1≤l1,l2,l3≤109), the side lengths of the triangle. It is guaranteed that the three side lengths forms a valid non-degenerate triangle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For test worth 30% of the score, there will be no acute triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Specification\n",
    "For of the T, output A if the triangle formed is acute, R if the triangle formed is right, O if the triangle formed is obtuse.\n",
