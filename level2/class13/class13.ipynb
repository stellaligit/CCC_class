    "## Terrific Triangles\n",
    "Plasmatic is having a test on the different types of triangles! However, he is unable to answer any questions because he was playing videogames in online classes. He vaguely remembers that the teacher taught 3 types of triangles -- acute, right and obtuse, but he doesn't remember how to identify any of them. He doesn't want to fail the test, so he needs your help to write a program to solve his problems.\n",

Instead, he gives you Q operations that he wants you to do with his collection of playdoughs, and each operation can be one of the two:\n",
