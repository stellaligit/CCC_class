    "## Chicken and Rabbit\n",
    "\"Chicken and rabbit\" is a famous math problem. As well known, each chicken has one head and two legs, while each rabbit has one head and four legs. Given the statement that the total number of heads for both chicken and rabbit is X and the total number of legs is Y. Please write a program to determin if there is a solution to satisfy the statement.\n",
