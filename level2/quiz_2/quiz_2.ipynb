    "## Bob's Reverse Number\n",

However, Bob doesn't like to interpret the number with the leftmost most significant digit, and he wants to interpret them the other way around, with the most significant digit being the rightmost one. Thus, Bob will first reverse both A and B and then find out the less number.\n",

    "## Food Savings\n",
    "After going on the Leviathan, Adam's stomach is rumbling for some food! A particular restaurant features N dishes, the ith of which costs Ci dollars. Currently, Adam is considering two disjoint selections of meals, namely from L1 to R1 and L2 to R2, inclusive. Normally, he would be forced to pay the sum of the prices of the food within the selections, but fortunately Adam has two very special coupons -- one for each selection! The first coupon reduces the price of a single selection by $10 (or makes it free if the price becomes negative); the second coupon halves the price Adam will have to pay for that selection. Given Q potential selections, can you help Adam find out how much he can save by optimally applying his coupons?\n",
