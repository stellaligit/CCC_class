    "## Doubling or Losing\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob are playing games again. If Bob gives Alice n dollars, Alice will give Bob double the amount. However, Alice is not good at math. When she calculates the result of 2 x n, sometime she will forget the last digit in the result. For example, if Bob gives Alice 12 dollars, the double amount should be 2 x 12 = 24. But Alice may get the incorrect result of 2 by missing the last digit, and thus gives back Bob  dollars. Now, Bob wants to know if he gives  dollars to Alice, how much money he may lose in the worst case.\n",
