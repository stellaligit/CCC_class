    "## Question called: Sunflower\n",
    "~~~~~~~~\n",
    "Barbara plants N different sunflowers, each with a unique height, ordered from smallest to largest, and records their heights for N consecutive days. Each day, all of her flowers grow taller than they were the day before.\n",
    "\n",
    "She records each of these measurements in a table, with one row for each plant, with the first row recording the shortest sunflower's growth and the last row recording the tallest sunflower's growth.\n",
