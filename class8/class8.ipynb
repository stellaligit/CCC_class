You assume this is due to that fact that you are in possession of the infamous Phone Microwave, which sends text messages to the past — for every second the microwave is set to, the message will go an hour back in time. In a desperate attempt to fix your internal temporal clock (which was ruined by confusing your past self with messages about the future), you decide to send one last message telling you not to acquire the suspicious-looking microwave in the first place. To do so, you need to write a program telling you what time your past self will receive the message, based on the current time and the microwave's settings.\n",
