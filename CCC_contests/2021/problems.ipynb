    "## Boiling Water\n",
    "At sea level, atmospheric pressure is 100 kPa and water begins to boil at 100◦C. As you go above sea level, atmospheric pressure decreases, and water boils at lower temperatures. As you go below sea level, atmospheric pressure increases, and water boils at higher temperatures. A formula relating atmospheric pressure to the temperature at which water begins to boil is\n",

Given the temperature at which water begins to boil, determine atmospheric pressure. Also determine if you are below sea level, at sea level, or above sea level. Note that the science of this problem is generally correct but the values of 100◦C and 100 kPa are approximate and the formula is a simplification of the exact relationship between water’s boiling point and atmospheric pressure.\n",

    "## Silent Auction\n",
    "A charity is having a silent auction where people place bids on a prize without knowing anyone else’s bid. Each bid includes a person’s name and the amount of their bid. After the silent auction is over, the winner is the person who has placed the highest bid. If there is a tie, the person whose bid was placed first wins. Your job is to determine the winner of the silent auction.\n",

Each of the next N pairs of lines contains a person’s name on one line, and the amount of their bid, in dollars, on the next line. Each bid is a positive integer less than 2000. The order of the input is the order in which bids were placed.\n",

Every time she sees a shelf of books, she rearranges the books so that all the large books appear on the left, followed by all the medium-sized books, and then all the small books on the right.
